Make your customers happier by educating them through self-help support

== Description ==

= Make your customers happier by educating them through self-help support =

Support Hero is self-service knowledge base that helps companies educate their clients. Helping them to create and deliver a game changing user education experience that increases retention and engagement, while reducing customer relationship costs.. Our advanced statistics will tell you what your users search for and what they need help with That will help you create the support content that matches their common requests.

With clients like Kissmetrics and Thinkific Support Hero has quietly been transforming the way users troubleshoot issues on the websites.

Most small software companies can't afford offering 24/7 customer support. It's just not feasible.  The other thing I would add is that offering efficient self help resources can help a lot with that. Users don't expect us to be available 24/7, but they still appreciate being able to find the answer to their question quickly!


### How it works: ######
= Create knowledge base articles and tutorials =
Tutorials and FAQs are key to help your users discover your site’s features. With Support Hero, you can easily create, import, and manage our support resources.

= Deliver Help 24/7, right within your app or website =
95% of users will leave your app if they can’t find the answers to their questions in less than 1 minute. With Support Hero, you can embed your Help Center within your app. It won’t be hard to find!

= Know what's working, and what's not =
Our advanced statistics will tell you what your users search for and what they need help with That will help you create the support content that matches their common requests.

= Leverage the statistics to improve your Help Center =
Keep improving your support resources to educate your users over time. You'll then easily be able to track the results of your efforts within Support Hero.
