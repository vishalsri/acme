This plugin allows you to add custom fields of type Image to user profile screens without having to write any additional code. No configuration required.

== Description ==

The BuddyPress Extended Profile add-on lacks support for Image type fields. The BuddyPress XProfile Custom Image Field plugin allows you to add fields of type Image to user profile screens without having to write any additional code. 

The images are stored by default into the /wp-content/uploads/profiles/[USER_ID] directory, where [USER_ID] is the ID of logged in user. You can override this default by hooking into the *bpxp_image_field_upload_dir* filter. 

The BuddyPress XProfile Custom Image Field plugin has a number of additional hooks that allow theme and plugin writers to modify its behavior.

This plugin requires BuddyPress version 1.5 and has been tested up to BuddyPress version 2.9.3

== Installation ==

1. Upload `bp-xprofile-image-field` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or use the automatic installation in the WordPress plugin panel.
2. Activate the plugin through the WordPress 'Plugins' menu
